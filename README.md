# Unix Dotfiles
A collection of unix dotfiles for my most used applications. These files are generally distro-intependant. Feel free to use and change them at your will.

## Programs with configurations found here
- Vim
- Tmux
- Git
- Bash

## Notes
Vim requires Vundle installed to correctly download and install the required plugins.
